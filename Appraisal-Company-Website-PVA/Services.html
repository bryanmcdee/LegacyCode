	<dt>Homeowners</dt>
	<dd>Homeowners need appraisals for a variety of reasons including refinance, 
	pre-listing services, asset valuations, and PMI removal.</dd>
	<dd>The most common appraisal ordered directly from a homeowner is a pre-listing 
	appraisal.  This is an appraisal to determine the market value of the home for 
	selling purposes.  It is hard to be unbiased when you are trying to value your 
	own home because you are emotionally attached to it.  An appraiser will give 
	you an unbiased opinion of value to help you set a realistic selling price.</dd>
	<dd>Homeowners are sometimes surprised to find out the market value of their home 
	is more than they thought.  An accurate real estate appraisal can help you 
	receive several thousand dollars more than you would have by setting the 
	asking price too low.  On the other hand, setting an asking price too high 
	will not attract buyers which means your house will not sell.  This wastes 
	time, money, and efforts.  An appraisal can help set a realistic price to 
	your house will sell quickly.   Getting a professional appraisal before 
	listing a home will help prevent any surprises.</dd>
